/*
 * Author: Ryan Nguyen
 * Program description: This is a program for a terminal based game that is inspired by the NBA all-star 3pt contest. The game supports 2 players where each player is attempting to score as many 3pt
 * 	shots as possible from 5 racks of basketballs on different spots on the 3-pt line. One of these racks is the "money-ball rack" where each ball is worth double the amount of a normal ball and each player
 * 	will be able to pick where that rack goes. There are also two "starry balls" that are further back and placed in between racks 2 and 3 and racks 3 and 4 that are worth 3 points.
